elPaqman - Pacman clone with linear programming using LPSolve
==============================================================

The purpose of this project is to make an example of a possible use of the shortest route algorithm in linear programming.
The game is very basic, be sure to read the Wiki if you want to see our proposed software design.

2.0 Installation
===================
Please install LPSolve and the Java wrapper
http://lpsolve.sourceforge.net/5.5/Java/README.html

Example for Ubuntu 32bits:
* Download http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/lp_solve_5.5.2.0_dev_ux32.tar.gz
* Download http://sourceforge.net/projects/lpsolve/files/lpsolve/5.5.2.0/lp_solve_5.5.2.0_java.zip
* Extract both
* cp <your download directory>/lp_solve_5.5.2.0_dev_ux32/liblpsolve55.so /usr/lib
* cp <your download directory>/lp_solve_5.5_java/lib/ux32/liblpsolve55j.so /usr/lib

That's it, if you want to make a new Java project using LPSolve, just add lp_solve_5.5_java/lib/lpsolve55j.jar to your project libraries
